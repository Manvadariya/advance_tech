## Project 1 : Attendance system with Hand detection 

The advanced attendance system utilizes facial recognition technology for accurate identification of individuals. It seamlessly integrates with database management to securely store attendance records. Real-time monitoring features enable administrators to track attendance remotely and receive alerts for anomalies. Multi-factor authentication enhances security, while a user-friendly interface simplifies registration and management. Overall, it streamlines attendance tracking processes with precision and efficiency.In the project if system find the student face successfully then it display student's face , id , branch and total attendance on the screen . 


## Project 2 : Windows Voice assistant

The assistant interacts with the operating system and executes various tasks based on user commands. It enhances the assistant's natural language understanding and conversation capabilities, allowing for more human-like interactions. This fusion of technologies enables the assistant to perform tasks such as opening applications, managing files, providing information, and even engaging in meaningful conversations with users, all within the Windows environment. It is powered by openAI. 

## Project 3 : Gesture Controll

The gesture control project enables users to adjust system volume and brightness through intuitive hand movements. By tracking gestures like relative movement of fingers for brightness and volume controll, it provides a touchless interface. Integrated with machine learning algorithms, it interprets gestures accurately for seamless control. This technology enhances user experience by offering a convenient and ergonomic way to interact with the system.
